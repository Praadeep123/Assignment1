    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?"

    "ans2=string represents a group of characters.strings are important beacause most of the data that we use in daily life will be in the form of strings.,
    "for examples names of persons, names of palces,address etc.\n",
    "variables is a container which store the values that assign on them by the users. for example:var='pradeep' and var is variable.
    "variables like a store box which can store some values.
    "3. Describe three different data types."
 
    "ans3 Three types of data type in python are:\n",
    "Numeric types respresent numbers. there are 3 sub types:=\t(int=123), (float=888.888), (complex=-1-5.5)\n",
